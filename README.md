# Indigo

An Arch-based Linux distro, designed to look good right out of the box.

This repository contains only the ISO releases of Indigo, in the GitHub releases page.


Indigo includes (or will include):
- The [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) Mocha theme, including cursors and icons
- A preconfigured and riced desktop environment or window manager, chosen by the user
- Fully functional package management via `pacman`
- AUR support with `yay` or other similar AUR helpers
- Incredibly modular installer, for the tinkerers out there
- Plus much more!


## Footnotes

Currently, this is only a prototype - Indigo is not yet in a usable state.
